# Distributed-File-Systems-Reliability

## 1. Project Background
Distributed storage systems are a fundamental building block of any modern scaling computing infrastructure, such 
as in clouds, scientific computing, or next-generation data centers. This is ultimately where most of the data resides, 
so the reliability of distributed file systems in the face of failures is critical. However, unlike local file systems, 
which have many tools and frameworks for testing, there are (still) no standard frameworks for evaluating the reliability 
of distributed file systems and their unique failure modes, like node and network failures! This not only means that each 
system must implement their own tests, but also that it is difficult to compare the reliability of multiple distributed 
file systems or evaluate their reliability from a third partyâ€™s perspective.

## 2. Goals: 
Design and implement a framework for basic failure testing of distributed file systems, which could be applied to 
the ultimate goal of the project, which is to test different use cases for MooseFS filesystem and generalize them for few other 
Filesystems. The overall testing framework would programmatically create and set up virtual machines (VMs) for Master 
Server, Metaloggers, multiple Chunkservers(ideally 50-60), and Client Servers using Ansible Playbooks and Terraform Plans 
for testing, run experiments, simulate node failures (e.g., terminating one or more VMs), verify the file system, destroy 
unneeded VMs, and repeat.

## 3. Users/Personas Of The Project:
- Admins and file system developers of projects which are either forked or a variants of the MooseFS Distributed 
filesystem, can consider the approach taken and generalize and automate reliability tasks by implementing an automation 
framework which will enable them to improve upon the reliability of their implementation. For example admins of LizardFS.
- Production engineers who want to assess the reliability of a the related distributed file Systems by following the
methodologies adopted here.
- Software developers and QA personnel working on developing file systems by utilizing the provided approach.

## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:
- The overall framework that will set up and tear down VMs, run experiments, and simulate failures.
- A set of experiments, such as writing to a large file, simulating a power failure (instantly rebooting all VMs), and 
then after they come back up, verifying that no data was lost.
- An interface with plugins for different distributed file systems. The primary goal for this project is to develop a 
reliability/failure-inducing framework for distributed filesystem that is focused on node failures. 
Stretch goals, if time allows, include:
    - Injection of block corruptions and errors on the local VMs;
    - Simulate network failures;
    - Performance testing specific to distributed filesystems.

## 4. Solution Concept
- Since their are many different types of distributed file system the idea here is to hide the steps taken behind clean 
interfaces, and thus testing different file systems would require developing different ansible playbooks which are an 
of these interfaces.
- Using Terraform to create VMs on MOC platform.
- Utilizing Ansible Playbook to configure and install MooseFS servers(Master, Metalogger, Chunkserver, Client) on the VMs.
- Use SSH/SCP/SFTP to connect to the client VM(s) and run the testing scripts on client.

## 5. Acceptance criteria
- Teraform Scripts should be able to create VMs on demand in MOC.
- Ansible playbooks should be able to setup the VMs through automation by installing & configuring different file systems.
- Ansible playbooks should be able to test different file systems.
- Thoroughly testing the MooseFS distributed file system and figuring out what are the possible interfaces required such an assessment.
- In the later phases we will try to provide implementation of these interface for other file systems and thus provide 
a guideline or a general approach to be taken to test any Distributed File System.

## 6. Release Planning:

#### Sprint 1 (12 Feb 2021 to 26 Feb 2021)
- Due for Week 1:
    - Learning Ansible & Installing it on VMs(VirtualBox VMs)
    - Learning Terraform & Experimenting on AWS VMs
    - Set up MooseFS on our local machine (with VirtualBox VMs)
- Due for Week 2:
    - Setting up Ansible Master Control node on MOC VM
    - Learning Terraform Experimenting on MOC
    - Set up MooseFS on MOC

The further releases of application are not fixed yet for a particular date and are dependent on evaluation results 
from experiments being conducted for the project.
