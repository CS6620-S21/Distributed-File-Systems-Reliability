# Distributed-File-Systems-Reliability

## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project:
Vision: Distributed storage systems are a fundamental building block of any modern scaling computing infrastructure, such 
as in clouds, scientific computing, or next-generation data centers. This is ultimately where most of the data resides, 
so the reliability of distributed file systems in the face of failures is critical. However, unlike local file systems, 
which have many tools and frameworks for testing, there are (still) no standard frameworks for evaluating the reliability 
of distributed file systems and their unique failure modes, like node and network failures! This not only means that each 
system must implement their own tests, but also that it is difficult to compare the reliability of multiple distributed 
file systems or evaluate their reliability from a third partyâ€™s perspective.

Goals: Design and implement a framework for basic failure testing of distributed file systems, which could be applied to 
testing different kinds of file systems. The overall testing framework would programmatically create and set up virtual 
machines (VMs) for testing, run experiments, simulate node failures (e.g., terminating one or more VMs), verify the file 
system, destroy unneeded VMs, and repeat. 

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:
Companies which need to test the stability of distributed storage systems to support their business.


## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:
The overall framework that will set up and tear down VMs, run experiments, and simulate failures.
A set of experiments, such as writing to a large file, simulating a power failure (instantly rebooting all VMs), and then 
after they come back up, verifying that no data was lost.
An interface with plugins for different distributed file systems. The primary goal for this project is to develop a 
reliability/failure-inducing framework for distributed filesystem that is focused on node failures. Stretch goals, if time 
allows, include:
Injection of block corruptions and errors on the local VMs
Simulate network failures
Performance testing specific to distributed filesystems.

## 4. Solution Concept
 
## 5. Acceptance criteria
A setup which can validate the reliability of any given Distributed File System

## 6. Release Planning:
Currently asked us to learn Ansible, Terraform and MooseFS.
Will add front end using Django if having spare time.
